# Udacity FEND Resume Project
## Refactored
This branch of the project has been refactored to use MVC.

## Setup
Download this repo and open `index.html` in your web browser.
You could also use a simple local server:
* Download this repo
* `cd` to the root folder
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Localhost will be running on port 8000 (or any you specify; control + C to stop the server).
